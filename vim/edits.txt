ShowMarks - fixes "not possble to change sign"
  Replaced the following line : 
      exe 'sign place '.id.' name=ShowMark'.nm.' line='.ln.'
      buffer='.winbufnr(0) 
        by the following three lines 

        if ln > 0 " conditional which tests for the line number as greater
            than 0 
                exe 'sign place '.id.' name=ShowMark'.nm.' line='.ln.'
                buffer='.winbufnr(0) 
                endif     " end conditional 

                Seems to be the easiest solution...
